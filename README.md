# CmdX
CmdX is a lightweight terminal written in a custom programming language. CmdX tries to be a smooth terminal that is fun and easy to use, 
without overcomplicating trivial tasks such as adding hotkeys.

Performance is also a big goal, though not that much effort has gone into actually optimizing the renderer yet. It uses OpenGL
as a renderer backend for now. The parsing of color codes can also be improved in the future.

# How do I CmdX
It's pretty simple; just download the latest release, unpack the zip file into a location of your choice, add that location to the path
and run cmdx.exe from whereever you like!
The directory from where CmdX is run is also its working directory.
The config file location is indicated in the little welcome message.
Only windows is supported, and it will likely stay that way.
